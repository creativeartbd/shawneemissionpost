SHAWNEE MISSION POST

Founded in 2010, the Shawnee Mission Post is the only news source wholly dedicated to northern Johnson County. With coverage of local government, schools and business Monday through Friday, it’s become the most-turned-to source for people who want to know what’s happening in our community.
